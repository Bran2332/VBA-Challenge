# Module 2 Challenge

In this challenge you will create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

*The ticker symbol

*Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

*The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

*The total stock volume of the stock.

*Format the percentage change to show as percentage and not "general" or any other format.

*Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

*Make sure the VBA script will run on every worksheet.

*Use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
